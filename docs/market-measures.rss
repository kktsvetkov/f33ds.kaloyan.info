<p>The correlation between SPY and IWM has been sustained at low levels for a record 164 trading days and counting. </p>
<p>Since 2020, IWM has carried a higher than average volatility differential to SPY...around 9 points higher IV than SPY. The lower correlation lends itself to higher diversification even between strategies in equity indexes. </p>
