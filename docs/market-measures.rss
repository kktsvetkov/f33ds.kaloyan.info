These are the positions where we focus on short theta, short IV, high POP, and defined profit.Engagement trades may not necessarily help or hurt a portfolio over time, so they should be done with extra small size since statistically. The value in engagement trades lies in the market awareness that builds a foundation to understand trading better.]]></content:encoded><itunes:image href="http://f33ds.kaloyan.info/market-measures.png"/><itunes:duration>826</itunes:duration></item><item><title><![CDATA[Calculate POT for Early Management]]></title><description><![CDATA[The probability of touch (POT) is the probability that at some point before expiration, the underlying price will reach the strike of the option. POT is calculated by multiplying the delta by two, so if you have a 10 delta put, the POT = 10 * 2 = 20%.Previously, we looked at the impact that early management had on probability of touch (POT), finding that when managing 16∆ options at 21 DTE, the POT was roughly equal to ½ the delta. But that was a small sample, simply looking at 16∆ calls and puts. What if we expanded the study?When managing early, can we estimate POT to be equal to ½ of delta? Or is there a different calculation that can apply broadly to all deltas?]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">220411_market-measures__6303612817001</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 14:36:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://feeds.tastytrade.com/media/6303612817001/6303612817001.mp4" length="236906545" type="video/mp4"/><itunes:author>tastytrade</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The probability of touch (POT) is the probability that at some point before expiration, the underlying price will reach the strike of the option.
