of the most challenging aspects of the options learning curve is understanding
the mathematics that these complex instruments are founded on. A dive into
the mathematics of options can easily lead to a seemingly endless void of

be made with a pretty superficial understanding of a handful of mathematical
concepts and statistics. Join Tom, Tony and Julia as they cover some of
the most important math concepts for trading options strategically.</p>
