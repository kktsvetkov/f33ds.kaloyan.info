<p>The market has been on an incredible bull run, but what happens if we see a pullback?</p>]]></content:encoded><itunes:image href="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt40263f25ec36953f/blt3cce1ddb3d392465/612cec20504fe365615e37c1/Market-Measures-S&amp;P-Pullbacks.jpg?width=2000&amp;height=2000&amp;fit=crop"/><itunes:duration>731</itunes:duration></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is a Standard Deviation?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Standard deviations give us context around the <em>typical</em> fluctuations around daily returns or trade P/Ls that happen around 70% of the time.
